TRAINING DATASETS

This directory contains the training subsets used to develop the machine learning models.

CONTENT

- Cumulative Subsets: Files named train_k.csv (e.g., train_1.csv, train_100.csv, train_800.csv).
- Purpose: These files are used to perform learning curve analysis, evaluating how model performance (R2, RMSE) improves as the number of training examples increases.

DOWNLOAD INFORMATION

Due to the file size and GitHub limits, the training datasets are hosted externally.
