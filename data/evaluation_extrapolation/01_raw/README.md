EXTRAPOLATION CASE STUDY: RAW DATA

This folder contains PLAXIS 2D simulation results for the extrapolation study (interaction of tunnels at varying distances).

STUDY DESIGN

Unlike the training set, these simulations use predefined distances (0.5m to 10.0m) to evaluate how models perform on "unseen" geometric configurations.

DATA CONTENT

- Plastic Points: These files include the "is_plastic" flag derived from PLAXIS stress-point results.
- Fixed Geometry: All tunnels are 3x3m.
